# Exercise 10

Create a decision tree that categorizes traffic as anomalous and normal (more than 80% accuracy).

Train the algorithm using a [training sample](https://courses.openedu.ru/asset-v1:ITMOUniversity+APPARTINT+spring_2019+type@asset+block@Data.zip) and verify it against the test sample in every task below.

Use the RapidMiner.The description and useful links are provided in the additional materials. Instructions for the task attached. Below are the main steps to complete the task:

1. Randomly split the dataset into a training sample (90%) and test sample (10%).
2. Develop a classifier using the training sample.
3. Visualize the decision tree. 
   Use the decision tree to identify the features that are important for traffic detection (examine all branches to assess the features used to categorize the traffic as anomalous or normal)
4. Apply the model to the 10% sample.
5. Estimate the classification accuracy.
6. For the given items, use the decision tree to categorize the traffic as anomalous or normal. Specify the classifier confidence in the results. Enter the solution rounded to three decimal places.
